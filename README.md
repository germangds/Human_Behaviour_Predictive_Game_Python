# Human_Behaviour_Predictive_Game_Python
In this project, I have created a programming game in which the computer tries to predict the playerâ€™s bid based on a simple machine learning algorithm. The game has 2 levels of difficulty and covers the main base of python programming. The game instructions were exported as a pdf and can be found in the repo as "Game Instructions".
